/*
 * Minimise the maximum difference between heights [V.IMP]
 * 
 * Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K,
 * you have to modify the height of each tower either by increasing or
 * decreasing them by K only once. After modifying, height should be a
 * non-negative integer.
 * 
 * Find out the minimum possible difference of the height of shortest and
 * longest towers after you have modified each tower.
