/*
 * Given an array which consists of only 0, 1 and 2.
 * Sort the array without
 * using any sorting algo
 * 
 * Solution:
 * A simple solution would be to perform a counting sort. We count the total
 * number of 0’s, 1’s, and 2’s and then put them in the array in their correct
 * order. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of
 * the input. However, this requires two traversals of the array.
