/*
 * Find the Union and Intersection
 * of the two sorted arrays.
 * 
 * Given two sorted arrays that represent two sets (elements in every array
 * are distinct), find the union and intersection of two arrays.
 * 
 * For example, if the input arrays are:
 * arr1[] = { 1,2,3,5,6,7}
 * arr2[] = {3,6,7,8,20}
 * 
 * Then your program should print Union as {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 20} and
 * Intersection as {3, 6, 7}. Note that the elements of union and intersection
 * can be printed in any order.
